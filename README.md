# Agritech Mobile Application

# Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that integrates multiple machine learning and deep learning models to perform various image and data classification tasks. The application is designed to handle tasks like wheat disease detection, seed quality assessment, seed germination detection, weed detection, solar power prediction, and air quality prediction.

# Features

Wheat Disease Detection: Classifies images of wheat leaves into categories like Brown Rust, Smut, Yellow Rust, and Healthy using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Seed Quality Assessment: Evaluates seed images to categorize them into different quality classes such as Broken, Immature, and Intact soybeans.

Seed Germination Detection: Uses YOLOv8 to detect germinated and non-germinated seeds in images.

Weed Detection: Classifies weed species from field images, leveraging deep learning for accurate recognition.

Solar Power Prediction: Predicts solar power output based on environmental data using a custom DLinear model.

Air Quality Prediction: Classifies air quality zones based on environmental data using a Random Forest Classifier.
